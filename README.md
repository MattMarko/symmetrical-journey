# symmetrical-journey

A personal novelty project that got created when developing a group university project in which I handled the data backend of the system.
During the creation of the database I saw an opportunity to get my head around both GitHub and Android Dev, so I'm currently making a companion app
that also doubles for an rest API tester.
